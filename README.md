# BartOS

Hobby x86-64 OS and kernel. I started this project to learn more about operating systems and how they work, the project started as an x86 project but I switched to 64 bit to get more experience working with technology more likely found in the industry. It is a higher half kernel which currently has a working physical memory manager, supports virtual memory with paging and interrupts with PIC (going to change to an APIC after I completely finish the virtual memory manager). I work on this project in my free time which is why it hasn’t progressed as much as I’d like it to.
